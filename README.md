# Hexagon's webdiff 

A Deno-based tool to recursively fetch and analyze web assets, focused on identifying changes or differences (hence the tentative name "webdiff").

**Features**

* **Recursive Fetching:** Starting from one or more seed URLs, the tool fetches the web page(s) and parses them to discover links to other assets (images, stylesheets, scripts).
* **Resource Discovery:**  Follows internal links within a target website (or websites) to discover and download connected assets.
* **Basic Analysis:** Currently focuses on:
    * Extracting text content from HTML
    * Detecting images
    * Finding links within the fetched assets 
* **Sitemap and robots.txt Parsing:** Can parse `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` to assist in the discovery of assets.

## Prerequisites

* Deno ([https://deno.land/](https://deno.land/)) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hexagon/webdiff 
   ```

2. **Change directory:**
   ```bash
   cd webdiff
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   deno run main.ts <target_url_1> <target_url_2> ... 
   ```
   * Replace `<target_url_1>`, `<target_url_2>` with the actual websites you want to analyze.
   * **Options:**
     * `--delay <milliseconds>`  Set a delay between fetches (default: 100ms)
     * `--output <directory>`  Specify the output directory (default: "./output")
     * `--verbose`   Enable verbose debugging output

## Example

```bash
deno run -A main.js --output ./my_data --delay 500 https://56k.guru 
```

**Output**

* Assets will be downloaded into the specified output directory. 
* You might need additional scripts or tools to compare the downloaded assets and highlight differences.


**Comparing Fetched Versions**

After running the `webdiff` tool on a website at different points in time, you might have two separate output directories. Here's how to use the standard `diff` command to compare them:

```bash
diff -r <directory_1> <directory_2> 
```

* Replace <directory_1> and <directory_2> with the paths to the two output directories generated by webdiff.
* The -r flag tells diff to compare the directories recursively.

**Understanding the Output**

The diff command will output differences it finds between files in the two directories.

* For text files (HTML, CSS, etc.), it will show line-by-line changes.
* For binary files (images, etc.), it will simply indicate that the files differ.

## Future Development

* Implement difference detection mechanisms (e.g., comparing text content, image hashes).
* Provide options for more structured reporting on differences.
* Improve filtering and customization of which assets are fetched.

## Disclaimer

This tool is in an early development stage. Use it at your own risk, and always respect the `robots.txt` rules of websites you target.

Let me know if you'd like to add more sections to the README (e.g., specific use-cases, a more detailed explanation of the code, or planned features)!
